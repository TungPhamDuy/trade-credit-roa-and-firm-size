**Project Title:** Examining the Effects of ROA and Firm Size on Company Trade Credit in Vietnam 

**Project Description:**
This project is focused on analyzing the relationship between Return on Assets (ROA), firm size, and company trade credit in Vietnam. The project utilizes a dataset of 752 companies in Vietnam to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), build regression models, and conduct tests for multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity. The goal of the project is to investigate the potential impact of ROA and firm size on receivables, and draw meaningful conclusions from the analysis.

**Dataset:**
The dataset used in this project comprises financial data of 752 companies in Vietnam, including variables such as ROA, firm size (categorized into small, medium, and large), and receivables (trade credit). The data is collected from reliable sources and has been pre-processed for analysis.

**Project Structure:**
The project follows the typical data analysis workflow, including the following main steps:

- Data Cleaning and Exploration: The dataset is cleaned and explored to gain insights into the data, identify patterns, and perform descriptive statistics to better understand the variables and their relationships.
- Data Visualization: EDA techniques are used to visually represent the data, including scatter plots, bar charts, and histograms, to provide a visual overview of the relationships between variables.
- Regression Modeling: Regression analysis is performed to build models that investigate the effects of ROA and firm size on trade credit. Multiple regression models are built, and statistical tests such as t-tests and p-values are used to assess the significance of the relationships.
- Testing for Multicollinearity and Heteroskedasticity: Diagnostic tests for multicollinearity and heteroskedasticity are conducted to evaluate the assumptions of the regression models and ensure the reliability of the results.
- Conclusion: The findings from the analysis are summarized in the conclusion section, which includes interpretations of the results, limitations of the study, and suggestions for further research.

**Conclusion:**
Based on the analysis, the project suggests that there may be a negative relationship between ROA and receivables, although the statistical significance of this relationship is not conclusive. Additionally, there appears to be a positive relationship between firm size (categorized into small, medium, and large) and receivables, but the statistical strength of this relationship is not significant. The low adjusted R-squared value indicates that there may be other factors influencing trade credit beyond the variables included in the model.

**Note:** Please note that this project has limitations, including the sample size and the specific context of Vietnam's business environment. Further research and analysis are recommended to validate the findings and explore additional factors that may affect trade credit in Vietnam.
